# Weekly Tasks 04

# Write a program, called collatz.py, that asks the user to input 
# any positive integer and outputs the successive 
# values of the following calculation.

# At each step calculate the next value by taking the 
# current value and, if it is even, divide it by two, 
# but if it is odd, multiply it by three and add one.

# Have the program end if the current value is one.
